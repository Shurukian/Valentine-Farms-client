## Planning and Development

I started off with an idea to make Farmers Markets more available. Having
access to them online would allow people to buy and sell items that they would
normally find at a farmers market, without always having to go to them.
I want the application to follow along the same lines as a Facebook or
instagram feed, allowing the application to be used in different environments.
The Back-End routes and schemas can be found [here](https://github.com/Shurukian/Valentine-Farms)

### Unsolved Problems

I would like my feed to auto-generate the listed products for all users so that
anyone new to the site would be able to see the products. I there needs to be
an additonal attribute within the Products Schema for the price of a product.
There also needs to be an update for the date within the modal showing it like
a normal date rather than a string, while the isOrganic will show as a boolean.
And finally, within the second phase of the app I would like to implement the
ability to add photos on the creation of a product.
